# HTN-2019 Backend Challenge

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment in the top level directory of this project. The steps on creating a virtual environment in Python 3 are listed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
3. Activate your virtual environment.
4. In your terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies this project uses.
5. To populate the database, run `python populate_db.py`.
6. Finally, to launch the Flask app, run `python run.py`. Once you've executed the command, click on this [link](http://localhost:5000/api/v1.0/) to check if the app is running fine. You should see "Welcome to this API!" at this endpoint.
